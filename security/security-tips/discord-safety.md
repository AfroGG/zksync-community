Here are the steps from the article "Tips against spam and hacking" on Discord's Safety Center. Please note that this is not advice, but simply a summary of the steps provided in the source:

1. Be cautious of unfamiliar links and files.
2. Be careful about sharing personal information.
3. Discord will only make announcements through official channels.
4. If you believe your account has been compromised, submit a report to Trust & Safety.
5. If youâ€™re getting unsolicited messages or friend requests, change your settings.
6. Discord uses a proactive spam filter to protect the experience of users and the health of the platform.
7. Joining a lot of servers simultaneously or sending a large number of friend requests might be considered spam.
8. Servers dedicated to mass copy-paste messaging, or encouraging DM advertising, are considered dedicated spam servers.
9. Invite reward servers are servers that promise some form of perk, often financial, for inviting and getting other users to join said server.
10. If a bot contacts you to be added to your server, or asks you to click on a suspicious link, report it to the Trust & Safety team.
11. Using a user token in any application (known as a Selfbot), or any automation of your account, may result in account suspension or termination.
12. If you believe your account has been compromised through hacking, reset your password and turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
13. If you believe your IP address has been targeted in a DDoS attack, reset your router, unplug your modem for 5-10 minutes, and contact your internet service provider (ISP) for assistance.
