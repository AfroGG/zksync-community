Here are the steps from the article "7 Pro Tips for Keeping Your Crypto Safe" by ConsenSys:

## 1. Know the Attack Vectors

Be aware of potential threats such as spoof sites and man-in-the-middle attacks. Double check URLs and verify software downloads. Always buy your hardware wallet directly from the manufacturer.

## 2. Generate strong passwords:

Use a random mnemonic generator to create a passphrase, or buy a hardware wallet to generate powerful keys and signatures for you. Use two-factor authentication for everything.

## 3. Use cold storage

Keep the majority of your crypto "cold" ‚Äî that is, air gapped and offline. Only keep an amount in exchanges and online wallets that you are willing to lose.

## 4. Test everything

Make small test transactions or practice with a tiny bit of funds on a test network before going full monty. Never manually type out addresses. Double-check the identicon of your target address.

## 5. Store your seed phrase(s) across different devices and locations

If you write it down on paper, consider making two copies and storing them in separate locations. Use both analog and digital just in case.

## 6. Maintain plausible deniability

Don't broadcast your holdings, and especially don't tell the world the exchanges where you keep all your crypto. You can hide accounts under different HD paths on your hardware wallet in case someone comes knocking.

## 7. Level up. Help the ecosystem

Contribute to the crypto community and help it grow.
